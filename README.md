# Oncology RAG App - Powered by Meditron 7B Medical LLM

## Overview
The **Oncology RAG App** is an AI-powered decision support tool designed to assist oncologists and healthcare professionals by providing real-time, context-specific insights. It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology and the **Meditron 7B Medical LLM** to enhance oncology diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care.

## Features
- **Real-time Oncology Insights** – Provides up-to-date cancer treatment protocols, clinical guidelines, and research.
- **AI-Powered Decision Support** – Utilizes Meditron 7B for accurate and context-aware medical information retrieval.
- **Seamless Information Access** – Reduces manual searches and streamlines data retrieval for clinicians.
- **Personalized Treatment Recommendations** – Assists in tailoring treatment plans based on patient-specific data.

## Motivation
Oncologists face challenges in keeping up with rapidly evolving medical knowledge. This app bridges that gap by providing immediate access to the latest oncology research, improving efficiency, and enhancing patient outcomes.


## Technologies Used
- **Meditron 7B Medical LLM** (Large Language Model for medical applications)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Python**
- **FastAPI / Flask** (for API development)
- **LangChain** (for LLM orchestration)

## Usage
1. Enter oncology-related queries.
2. The app retrieves relevant medical literature and generates AI-assisted responses.
3. Use insights for improved diagnosis and treatment planning.
